### Project Description
The project aims to create a webpage that helps users (students, faculty , visitors)locate specific events happening on campus as well as navigate to the main campus locations. It serves as a digital campus guide with event management and location-search capabilities.

### The Problem statement
Develop a webpage that helps users locate events happening on campus and find key campus locations such as libraries and cafeterias. The system integrates an interactive map, a search feature, and a database to manage event and location information, providing a seamless navigation experience.

### The Solution
The solution involves creating a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for event and location search, coupled with an interactive map using Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap. A Flask backend communicates with a MySQL database to store and retrieve event and location details, ensuring efficient navigation and real-time updates for users.
